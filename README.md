# Cloud-hosted Notebook Project

In this project, we set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab to demonstrate data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset.

## Cloud-hosted Notebook
You can access the cloud-hosted Jupyter notebook directly via this link [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mG-g9BC0jwsBk5gswgo1yuYPqJ362xpK?usp=sharing).

## Setup and Configuration
### Google Colab
1. Navigate to Google Colab.
2. Create a new Jupyter notebook.
3. The notebook is automatically saved in Google Drive and can be shared via a link.
4. The computational resources are provided by Google, so there's no setup required on the user's end.

## Data Manipulation Tasks
We used the 'iris' dataset for demonstration. The following tasks were performed on the dataset:

1. **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset was loaded directly from seaborn's data repository.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Displayed the first five rows of the dataset.
- Provided information about the dataset, such as data types and non-null counts.
- Conducted basic statistical analysis to understand the data distribution.
3. **Data Filtering:** Filtered data based on petal length to showcase data manipulation capabilities.
  
## Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn

## Concluding Remarks
This project serves as an introduction to cloud-hosted data solutions, making it easier for individuals and teams to collaborate, share, and leverage the power of cloud computing for data analysis tasks.
